        we are a community of romantics. we are about sharing our own words on love, and reading about others' experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        as a community, we represent the following principles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            sometimes we need to tell someone about our love, but we cannot &mdash; for various reasons. this is a place to help you safely talk about your love.
        </li>
        <li>
            one rewarding way to live your life is to listen, provide support, encouragement and acceptance of others'. this is one place to do this.
        </li>
        <li>we cannot condone bullying, trolling or other disruptive behavior due to the sensitive nature of our letters. please see our rules in our <a href="~/terms#rules">terms of use</a> for more information.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>we are currently working on a book that includes letters and comments made on this site from november 8th, 2013 onwards. (yay!)
    </p>
    <p>the book will be published early 2015. please stay tuned for more information.</p>
