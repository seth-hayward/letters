            we are a community of romantics. we are about sharing our own words on love, and reading about others' experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            as a community, we represent the following principles:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                sometimes we need to tell someone about our love, but we cannot &mdash; for various reasons.
                this is a place to help you safely talk about your love.
            </li>
            <li>
                one rewarding way to live your life is to listen, support, and encourage other people in your
                community. this is one place to do this.
            </li>
            <li>
                we do not allow bullying, trolling or other disruptive behavior due to the
                sensitive nature of our letters. please see our rules in our <a href="~/terms#rules">terms of use</a>
                for more information or use the <a href="~/feedback">feedback</a> page to contact mods for help.
