I love this website! I think the people who run it do such a good job. I just have one question. How is it run? Do lots of people run it, or just one creator, how do letters get chosen for the front page?? I just think this whole website is great. Thanks for all you do.

Hello! I just wanted to say, that letterstocrushes.com is a really great site! I loove looking at all the letters on here, as well as making some of my own :) Just a few questions :P How does a letter get on the front page, does it depend on how many hearts the letter gets? And could you please put a link to the crushes chat site? Which is this: http://crushes.aws.af.cm/ Please reply soon :) Thankyou so much for making a great site where everyone can get together as the LTC Community! :D

To whom this may concern, Thank you for supplying me with a safe haven for my thoughts and worries and struggles and dreams and desires and everything. This place has helped me sift through broken memories and regrets and it has instead helped to turn them into learning experiences. I have met beautiful people with beautiful minds and I have received support from complete strangers while getting to know their life stories. I am deeply in love right now and I hope I can work up the courage to profess that love to the one who has my heart. Thank you again.

+++

It would be really cool if you guys could create an app?

+++

Feb 25

I was wondering what happened to styling the letters? We still can do bold and italicized fonts but before we could do coloured fonts and different types of fonts if we did it on MS word then transferred it onto this site. and I was also wondering why the symbols and some of the special characters don't work anymore? Only question marks show up in their place...

+++

Feb 20

Please help! It won't let me login and when I've tried to reset my password, an error occurs every time... On another note, I love this website so much. I found it through StumbleUpon. Thank you so much for such a wonderful thing!

+++

Feb 20

Sooo I tried to send a letter, and your page pretty much just slapped me and said 'no.'

+++

Hi, I'm having trouble signing into my account and it will not let me change my password. is there anything that I can do to fix this? Thank you, Erin

how do I unhide a letter I accidentally hide?

For some reason, it wouldn't let me submit, three times.

Best. Website. Ever.

a mobile friendly site or application for iphones and andoid would be amazing. and. possibly a text font size zoom...

Is there any way to un-hide a letter? I accidentally hid one and I want it back! Thanks so much!

This website makes my day everyday <3 I smile so big whenever I read these amazing stories. We really aren't alone :) x American Girl

+++

Nov 28 '12

Thank you for this site. It's a marvelous place to hear from others in similar positions to my own. I love that there is a place for these stories to be shared completely and utterly anonymously if the author so wishes.

+++

Nov 26 '12

I suggest trying to filter the search.. If i search one letter, say "b", i get every single letter with the letter "b" even if its in a word like "beautiful" instead of just the initial "b" that i wanted...just a suggestion.

+++

Nov 26 '12

You should make an app!

+++

Nov 19 '12

Great website! Changed my life and made me believe in love

+++

Nov 17 '12

I really like this website, its nice to know other people feel the same deserted feeling. I love wishfully hoping for many of these romantic stories to happen to myself... although this may be bad because i have recently lost all hope for men, a website can not change that. If one could this one is the closest to healing my feelings

+++

Nov 15 '12

Heartwarming.

+++

Nov 3 '12

Hey there seth, know your probably busy, what with the chat having to be moved and all (btw sorry for the stuff i said on the chat the other day, said in bad judgment) anyway, have you ever considered making a letters to crushes app? Thought that that might be a cool addition to phones and stuff

+++

Nov 3 '12

I love this website. It gives me hope and makes me so happy to know that I'm not the only one that's in this position or has these feelings. Thank you LTC! You make me a happy, hopeful person:)

+++

Oct 15 '12

hello LTC, i am contacting you due to the inability to edit my letter. please let me know if there's something i can do because these typos will forever frustrate me. thank you for your time, and have a wonderful day.

+++

Oct 14 '12

This site is so beautiful. It lets people express their love and heartbreak in a way we might never have been able to without it. It teaches people all over the world about other people's mistakes, and how to avoid them. It shows you that even when you feel as if it's the end of world, there is always somebody who has it worse. And even when you feel as if you are "like, omg totes in luv!!!!!!!!!!", there is always somebody out there who is in TRUE love. So many beautiful, brave people writing so many beautiful, brave letters. Thank you, creators of Letters to Crushes, for building a community of dreamers, romantics and friends.

Oct 13 '12

Hi seth!!! It's me Ahnna I think we met once on chat. Anyways, why is the front page so backed up ? Just wndering since its gotten to over 2 months behind! you might want to fix that :) ok bye! -Ahnna PS you should come on chat sometime, it would be awesome having you there and im sure everyone would love it!

Hi!

I can login but i can't access any of facilities after login. It says "Sorry an error occurred" everytime i try to got to bookmarks, permanent links or any particular letter. May b this site is not working properly in my country. I'm from India. I really want to use my account on LTC. 

Awaiting Solution!

Thanks

+++

Oct 3 '12

Hi Seth! :) So for some reason when I'm on my ipad the chat doesnt work well...it keeps going to the top of the page for no reason. :/ I just scroll back down then it goes up again. Then when I'm typing it stays but as soon as I'm done up it goes again! :( Well anyway I hope you can fix it! :) Thanks, Kristi

Sep 24 '12

Hello Seth! My name is Jenna Marie and I'm an active member of LettersToCrushes and the chat :)

I was thinking of some things you could do to improve this amazing community, and I (And others) were thinking about you creating a chat app. Often times, I'd like to go on the chat on my phone (iPhone), and often times it glitches. Sometimes I am not able to have access to a computer, so it's a bit of a bother, but its fine. :)

I was thinking if it was possible for you to create an LTC app, or a chat app. I think it would be good for the site as well as the community. It will give you a chance to get the site more viral, and the community will be able to interact with others easier.

I personally do not see any downside to having an LTC app, because it will only make the community bigger. I suggest if you do create one, that you find or create a program to handle spam, to block users who send spam. Maybe you could have them sign in on the app before using it, to their LTC log in and password. If you see a pattern of the same person, spamming, you could ban them from the app.

I'm not sure, I'm just throwing suggestions at you. But I feel as if the community will only grow with the creation of a chat, or an LTC app.

Thank you for your time, and I appreciate you reading this email :)

+++

I can't edit a letter from my iPad. I don't know if that's your fault or mine or apple's. But if you could figure out how to fix it that woul be great thank you sooooooooo much <3

Sep 1 '12 - from Mia B.

Dear Mr. Hayward,

I hope it doesn't creep you out that you're getting an email from an unknown person. But I figured it'd maybe be nice for you to know that I've been frequenting your LTC site for just over a year now, and I love it.

I figured I'd send this email now because my boyfriend has known about the site for a while now, and today, as we're Skyping (and as I type this, actually), he's using all his computer skills to try to find information on you (he's a computer person as well; majoring in business and computer science. I understand pretty much none of all that high-tech stuff.) Anyways, he found your email through some website called whois.net, and I thought I'd send you a letter as he pokes around the Internet.

So, Mr. Hayward, (or Seth, whichever you prefer random strangers calling you), thank you for making Letters to Crushes. It's helped me vent whenever I need to, and reading the stories other people post always makes me happy, even if the letters aren't necessarily the cheeriest. It's a website that makes a lot of people happy.

With much admiration,
Mia Barger

P.S. My boyfriend says the hidden message in the source code is nice, and that it's good of you to not put ads on the website. And I have to agree with him.

to Seth 
One more quick thing I forgot to mention; the chat seems to be acting up on Google Chrome. Me and Gina have had this problem. We would enter something into the chat box and it would go to the top instead of the bottom, making it a little difficult to see what everyone is saying. Again, just wanted to let you know, and super sorry for bothering you when you're so busy! D:
Much thanks, 

+++

Aug 1 '12

Hey Seth,
Just wanted to let you know that for some reason it seems like you're unable to bold and italicize letters. I'm not sure how it would be fixed but I wasn't sure if you're aware of it or not. 
Hope life is becoming less of a zoo!

Jul 9 '12 - Z. <z*@gmail.com>

Hey Seth! 
So I've been doing my very best at queuing letters.  I do my best to be fair in those I choose and try to make sure that they're original. I've seen a couple times though, that this sometimes doesn't happen. We'll pick a letter thinking it's original, and when it makes the front it turns out it wasn't (example "I just want to put my face in his face" apparently comes from New Girl, a show I have never watched D:). 
How can I avoid that? I feel bad when it's a direct quote from a song or show when all of these other lovely writers have poured their hearts out into their story. Don't get me wrong - quotes are sometimes much better at explaining our situations than our own words can. I just feel bad sending out "copied" thoughts when I feel this site is so unique at times.
Should I be worried about the unoriginal work, and if so, how could I stop accidentally choosing those letters?
Much thanks, and hope everything is well,
[Z.]

Hey [Z.],

I'm so sorry for taking so long to respond... I'm a terrible emailer right now.

Thanks so much for queueing though... it's very important. And it's very much appreciated, as well...

And it's a lot of work, so I appreciate it...

But anyway, I hear what you are saying about finding a letter that is unique. I think LTC is a place for original letters (the front page, at least) -- so I would definitely work hard to make sure that a letter I posted was somewhat unique. And the only good way I was able to do this was a google search. Usually a quote would turn up other results, facebook groups, etc...

Sometimes I'd end up posting stuff that wasn't original, but was someones pretty rare. So the only good way to get that off the front page was to "hide" it... but that's kind of rude as well, so I need to make an unpublish button... but hiding was the best thing , though not a great solution. 

Anyway, terribly sorry for the delay, sorry I couldn't be more helpful, life is a zoo right now sadly,
seth

Hey Seth!
No problem at all! I understand. I'm glad I'm helping :) It's kind of mind blowing to be honest, to be helping to run the site that I am so very much in love with. 
I thought that's what I could do..an unpublish button would be a great idea too. Let's just hope we don't have any more letters with too much unoriginality. 

I hope your life becomes less of a zoo soon! I mean it's summer, come on! ;D 
Wish you the best and thank you,
[Z.]

It's a great idea, and it reminds me of some other books published based off a website, like the book of awesome. I think it would be amazing If LTC published something in the likes. But I talked to Zaakirah and she said you can get pretty busy, but anyways, it's just an idea :3 and alot of people seem to like it :)

Hi Blue!

I'm very sorry about taking so long to get back to you. Life is very crazy for me right now. 

But anyway, I am happy that you are excited about the admin powers. It's kind of rude of me to just presume that you (or Seth or Gina) want them, so please feel free to tell me to turn them off if you'd like. 

"Queue"
These are the upcoming letters that are going to be published. What I normally do is select letters from the Popular page (pressing the queue link on the letters, above the comments). Every 12 hours, a letter is published from the queue to the front page. (6pm and 6am.)

"Popular" (bad name for this, I'm sorry):
These are letters that have been heart'ed by the most unique IP addresses -- which translates roughly into the letters that have been liked by the most people (for that time frame.)

The most important thing to keep in mind is the date. On the popular page, you'll see that the letters begin with the date of the first letter on the first page. It may seem weird, but it's done this way so I can be sure that I've read all the letters that got a lot of hearts. Said another way, it prevents large gaps of time on the front page which I think makes people feel bad. 

.. OK, as far as what letters to queue (i.e. what letters for the front page) -- it's really up to you. My impression of what goes on the front page is different than other people. It's hard to define what should be on the front page -- it's like one of those things that you know when you see it, I guess. I prefer original, healthy, non-hateful letters. 

I'm not sure if that makes sense or not. Maybe. Please ask questions if you'd like, and I will try harder to answer them better. Please let Seth and Gina know as well, if they'd like. I should tell them myself right now, but I owe Gina a letter already and my life is a mess atm. Agh. 

Anyway, thanks, take care, 
seth

this site is amazing <3

+++

May 3 '12

Hi! I would just like to say that I love this site and that it really does lite up my day :D

And also, that you guys should update the "best" category and make it uptace automatically so that the ones who are there, truly are the ones with the most hearts and responses :)
Thank you and btw, who ever started this site is my personal hero!

+++

May 1 '12

Hey, Seth, this is Chels.  There is a girl going under the name of "Cherie" on chat who is harassing Jake (another guy on the chat).  Her language is harmful and defamatory towards him.  Her IP address is: 99.112.61.125 .  I would highly appreciate this IP address being blocked; however, that's completely up to you.

+++

Apr 30 '12

Hey seth! Blue here. I have something to ask you and this seemed to be the best spot to do it.
So I've realized that you've given me (along with Gina and Seth!) admin powers, for which I feel awesomely privileged. (Thanks very much for that!) But, how exactly do we use them? I have an idea, but I'd prefer, as I think Seth and possibly Gina would, some clarification. What it means to queue letters, what to do with them after, what types of letters we should be looking for, etc.
It'd be great if you could do that for us!
Much thanks and keep up the awesome work,
Z

I love this site so much! Thank you for creating a place that we can share our thoughts with others who care.

i love this site so much! thank you:)

+++

Apr 22 '12

I kinda wish the text editor was bigger so when I'm writing a long letter I can just look up to make sure I'm keeping my info consistent. This whole scrolling thing makes it tough to do that.
Thanks much.

None of the site is loading. It keeps saying there's an error :(

Apr 13 '12

However much i love this site (and i do love it a alot), i feel like there's no patterns to what makes it onto the front page. Sometimes i think it's amount of hearts, but then that theory breaks down, so i was just wondering, how does it work?

+++

Apr 11 '12

Hey I just wanna say thank you so much for creating this site!!! Also, I got this page saying there was an error with the server. So yea I don't know if That's fixable or not. But thanks again for LTC! <3

+++

Apr 7 '12

I like this site. It's cute, but I don't feel the need for it to have hearts on it. It would make everyone feel better. Being able to heart letters is like rafting peoples feelings and that should not be an option. we re all on here to relate to other People by reading their thoughts not by liking someones instead of others. I think others would also appreciate it. I hope you guys take this seriously and take the time do think about this.
Thank you.

+++

Apr 4 '12

because I love this site so incredibly much - just the whole concept of being able to say something you can't but wish you could... so I think it would be super duper fluperly awesome if you guys created a site where people could send anonymous messages to well.. anyone. it could be letters to whoever? that basically allows you to write your thoughts or whatever it is you feel you want to, need to say but you can't say it or you don't have anybody who will listen or whatever the situation is! I think it would be a big hit if you sort of set it out like this? because it's simple and easy. I've tried googling websites like what I've described and there have been none that come close so I think you guys would do a great job at hosting this website, just saying! :) have a great day and thank you for this website :)

+++

Apr 3 '12

p.s. I just sent something to you, but I would also like to say that this website is absolutely genius... I don't know about other people, but it's certainly made me feel better. Although I tend to write sappy and depressing stuff which I may or may not laugh at later, it's a great way to vent. Genius, genius, genius. Thanks so much!

Mar 31 '12

I love this website. It's helped me get rid of any sad feelings and now I know that people out there feel/go through the same things I do. I'm not alone and I know that now because of this website. THANK YOU!

+++

Mar 30 '12

This is a fun site, it makes me feel normal :)

+++

Mar 30 '12

you have to prevent being able to heart your own letters.  because some people just heart their own, destroying the purpose of this site.  so one computer= one heart? just a suggestion.  or one I.P address= one heart.

+++

Mar 24 '12

first of all, i absolutely love this website. there's nothing like it. with any other website, you have to submit something and wait a long time for it to be "approved", which is just frustrating. and this website has been a great way for me to let my feelings out about my crush.

i was just curious on how the site worked. do the letters with the most hearts make the home page? and how many hearts are required? i'm just simply, curious hahaha.
thank you for this website, really.

yours,
anonymous-lover.

Mar 15 '12

Is usage of foul language not condoned on this site?

+++

Mar 10 '12

+++

Mar 10 '12

I think it would be better if the bookmark button was already with each letter like the heart button so that I won't have to open a new link with the one letter I want to bookmark. It would be less of a hassle. Thank you :)

Mar 1 '12

I. Need. Help.
When I login is says, "sorry, an error has occured" but it logs me in anyways, then when I try to view a response, or send one, it asks me to email you for help (which I already did) I really need some help!

+++

Mar 1 '12

Please please please make a letters to crushes app! I am addicted to this website and I think it would make it gain a lot of popularity, not to mention how convenient it would be. I know its easier said than done, I just wanted to throw the idea out to someone who may be able to do something about it!

Sincerely, [B.].

Feb 28 '12

Hi. I think it would be nice if you had categories for the letters. It would be a very nice feature, because when I have a crush, I'll want to read the stories involving crushes, and when going through a breakup, the sad breakup stories would be what I would want to read.
These may not be great, but some categories could be: crushes, breakups, relationships, true love, etc.
Thanks for listening.

Dear letters to crushes,
May I say thank you for the very idea of this website.
I feel that it has helped me so much in the long haul and I really feel better being able to see that Im not alone in this crazy messed up world.
Thank you for allowing people like me to share stories that make people laugh, dream, love, and even cry.

Thanks,
B

Awesome site! One thing that would be great if changed is that when searching, you can't search single letters, nor case sensitively, nor multiple words. This would be great if fixed :D

i understand that letters are written anonymously, but i wish we could go back and delete them if you signed up with an email.

Dear Seth,
Thank you so much for this site (again for the billionth time), i don't know how else i could go through this year if i hadn't had ltc.
I'm hoping to be back one day, which doesn't mean that i won't be reading the letters or writing to my friend SomeOne because i surely will be visiting here often, nothing else can give me the feelings that this site has given me. But as a writer, this is a goodbye for a while. I won't be Firefly anymore, i infact gave that up couple of months ago, i just coulnd't really put it out there, you know? Because that would force me to accept things - which i should have long ago.
Anyway, i hope you're doing great!
Thanks for everything, and farewell^^
-Senay

I think that there should be a share button on this site so that you can invite others to join...

Hey Seth,
You should create a new chatroom because there are impersonators. Alexis said we should make a Xat chatroom because you can ban people, and also when you add friends they'll show up in bold.
Something like that.

Thanks.

Hello! I've had quite a lot of trouble getting into my account for some time now. I can't remember my password, and when I go to reset it, the error message always comes up. I use this email for the login. 
Thank you!

This is a good site for those who want to tell confess their feelings out. They can also find people who are like them too, feeling what they're feeling. Like me, I found people who could understand my feelings as they were in the same position as me.Thank you for operating this website. :)

LTC helps me cope with reality. It gives me something to believe in; hope. Even though maybe my crush won't like me, there are some great people out there that I still have a chance with.

To the creator: Thank you.

"Edit letter is not working"

"this is an amazing website"

"I forgot my password! Can you guys please send it to me, or send me a link so that I can change it??? :( Thanks!"

"Great site! I've created an account but it's really weird how you can bookmark a letter twice and then if you want to delete it you can't. :( And can you unhide your letters? Because I thought that hiding meant deleting them off your bookmarks list. Besides that everything is fantastic." - m-------@hotmail.com

"   This isn't really feedback or anything but I've written a couple of letters, all ending with ... or something of the like and for a while when I've pressed search with any of those combinations none of mine have popped up... and... those letters are really special to me, really special, and I know whoever runs this site is probably really busy and stuff but... I don't know, a follow up email would be nice whether it's just a "sorry, your letters have sort of been deleted" or if you can find them and it's fixed, just... yeah.
   Also, as feedback, this site is really amazing and I've been reading the letters since this was just a tumblog... and it'd be cool if Letters From The Crushed were a functioning site too. A lot of sadness and happiness gets mixed up here.
So, yeah, thanks in advance if you reply.

 - Jessica (the whole ... thing is based off a nickname, yeah... I don't know why I'm telling you this.)" - o------------@gmail.com

"A recovery/reset password setting would be very helpful." - d----------@gmail.com

"Your site has made me feel better about myself and my love life so much that i dont cry anymore... thanks a lot. I mean it with a lot of passion"

"If you forgot your login password, is there a way to reset the password or to retrieve it?
'cause that would be very useful." - b---------@gmail.com

"letters to crushes is a fantastic website.
i love expressing my feelings on here to total strangers because the likes make me feel like ive been heard. but what would really be fantastic if the bookmarks page would work a little more smoothly... but everything else is really fantastic!!!!!" - e-----------@aim.com

"I love your website. I just wish there were a way to recover my password, because I forget mine now. I forget how many letters I've written, but I know it's more than 10." - bailey_spurling@yahoo.com

"I forgot my password, is there anyway you send it to me?" - d-----@gmail.com

"I think that you should make people address their letters to people. just have a box for To: and From:  Otherwise, many times you read letters and people have no clue who they are from and its just turning us into bigger love-recluses" - i---------@rocketmail.com

"i think the search engine should be much more efficient. it doesn't go back to letters from a long time ago. also, make it more specific for searches. maybe try setting it up so we can search by date? idk.. just some suggestions :)"
